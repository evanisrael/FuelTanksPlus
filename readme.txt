Fuel Tanks Plus

by Ed T. Toton III, aka NecroBones.


Installation:

1. Simply copy the "FuelTanksPlus" folder into your GameData folder. If upgrading from a 
previous version, be sure to delete the old one from GameData first (this is the cleanest option).

2. Also make sure you have a current copy of ModuleManager, and either the Firespitter Core (DLL) or
the Intersteller Fuel Switch mod (preferred). These can be found through CKAN or KerbalStuff.
